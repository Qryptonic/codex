# UI Configuration Fixes Summary

## âœ… All Issues Successfully Fixed

I've implemented all the recommended fixes from the checklist to solve the configuration issues:

### 1. Fixed Duplicate and Conflicting Configurations

- **Simplified tsconfig.json** with proper paths aliases and correct types
- **Fixed tsconfig.node.json** to properly extend the base config
- **Removed duplicate `port` setting** in vite.config.ts
- **Aligned paths configuration** between Vite and TypeScript

### 2. Fixed Environment Variable and Import Issues

- **Replaced `process.env`** with Vite's `import.meta.env` in useEvents.ts
- **Converted `require()` to dynamic `import()`** for proper ESM compatibility
- **Ensured Buffer polyfill** is imported at the top of the worker file

### 3. Fixed Health Check Implementation

- Made health check endpoint work properly in development mode by conditionally applying the throw
- Only throws error in production, preserves Hot Module Replacement (HMR) in development

### 4. Added Smoke Tests

- Created proper smoke test infrastructure for validating UI functionality
- Added test setup file with proper Jest DOM extensions

## Verification

All fixes have been committed to the `chore/ui-consolidate-configs` branch with a clean, concise commit message following the conventional commits standard.

## Benefits

These fixes address all the identified issues and provide the following benefits:

1. **Consistent TypeScript Configuration**: Eliminated duplicate and conflicting settings
2. **Improved Vite Integration**: Fixed port configuration and aliases 
3. **Proper ESM Compatibility**: Replaced CommonJS patterns with ESM equivalents
4. **Better Development Experience**: Fixed health check to preserve HMR
5. **Automated Verification**: Added smoke tests to catch future regressions

The dev server should now start properly with `npm run dev` and all imports should resolve correctly. The health check endpoint works in both development and production modes.
