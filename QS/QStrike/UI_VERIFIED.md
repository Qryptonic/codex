# QStrike UI Port Standardization Verification

## Changes Successfully Implemented

1. ✅ **UI Port Standardization** - All UI instances now use port 3000 by default:
   - Updated `vite.config.ts` to use port 3000 with environment variable override
   - Added port configuration to `preview` settings 
   - Added middleware for health endpoint

2. ✅ **Environment Configuration**:
   - Created `.env.development.example` with `VITE_UI_PORT=3000`
   - Updated environment variable handling in app code

3. ✅ **Docker Configuration**:
   - Updated `docker-compose.dev.yml` to map port 3000 correctly
   - Added proper healthcheck configuration

4. ✅ **Documentation & Scripts**:
   - Updated `README.md` to reference port 3000
   - Enhanced `run-dev.sh` with proper port handling
   - Added comprehensive Makefile with PORT variable support
   - Added GitHub Actions workflow with proper PORT configuration

5. ✅ **Health Endpoint**:
   - Added `/__health` endpoint that returns "OK" with 200 status code
   - Confirmed it works across port configurations

## Verification

Port configuration has been successfully tested:

- Basic UI loads on port 3000 by default (`npm run dev`)
- Port override works correctly (`PORT=4000 npm run dev`)
- Health endpoint properly returns "OK" on configured port

## Next Steps

1. Take a screenshot of the working dashboard and save it to:
   ```
   docs/evidence/live-dashboard.png
   ```

2. Merge the changes into the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge chore/ui-port-3000
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Deploy the changes to the development environment.

All acceptance criteria have been met. The UI will consistently run on port 3000 for new developers, and the PORT environment variable allows flexible overrides as needed.
