# QStrike Binary WebSocket Implementation Summary

## 1. Key Changes Implemented

### Server-Side (WebSocket Gateway)

1. **Raw Binary Protocol**
   - Removed Avro decoding on the server side
   - Send raw buffer directly: `socket.send(message.value)`
   - Removed schema import and loading to avoid Avro compatibility issues

2. **JWT Authentication & Tenant Isolation**
   - Added strict JWT `sub` claim validation against job owner
   - Proper bearer token extraction from `Authorization` header
   - Tenant isolation enforced via `getClientIdForJob` check

3. **Consumer Flow Control**
   - Implemented queue counter for message backlog tracking
   - Consumer pauses after 500 unacknowledged messages
   - Added ACK handler that resets counter and resumes consumer

4. **Infrastructure Health Checks**
   - Added health checks for Redpanda and Schema Registry
   - Services wait for dependencies with `condition: service_healthy`
   - Gateway now has `/health` endpoint that reports Kafka connectivity

### Client-Side (UI)

1. **Embedded Avro Schema**
   - Schema JSON embedded directly in the code instead of fetched over network
   - Eliminates schema loading failures and reduces startup time
   - Ensures Avro binary decoding can happen immediately

2. **Binary Mode WebSocket**
   - Setting `ws.binaryType = 'arraybuffer'` to properly receive binary data
   - Avro decoding happens client-side only

3. **ACK Mechanism**
   - Client sends 'ACK' messages after receiving threshold of events
   - Acts as flow control to prevent server memory overflow
   - Automatically resumes paused Kafka consumer

## 2. Git Commit Hash

The complete implementation is available in commit `55d5669` with description:

```
Fix: Raw binary protocol, JWT sub check, and consumer backpressure

- Remove Avro decoding on the server side, pass raw binary buffers
- Add strict JWT subject claim (sub) check against job owner
- Implement proper consumer pause/resume with ACK flow control  
- Fix WebSocket delayed stream handler to pass binary messages
- Add Jest test for WebSocket ACK mechanism
- Add healthchecks to docker-compose.yml for sequenced startup
- Create test-event.json for verifying binary transmission
```

## 3. How to Test Binary Protocol

1. **Start Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   cd QStrike
   docker compose up -d redpanda schema-registry
   ```

2. **Start Gateway and UI**
   ```bash
   # Start gateway on port 8080
   cd src
   PORT=8080 node dist/server.js

   # Start UI on port 3000
   cd ui
   npx vite preview --host --port 3000
   ```

3. **Generate Test Event**
   ```bash
   # Using the prepared test event
   cat test-event.json | docker compose exec redpanda rpk topic produce qstrike.events
   ```

4. **Verification in Browser**
   - Open the UI at http://localhost:3000
   - Open DevTools > Network > WS > Frames
   - Verify binary messages from server
   - Verify 'ACK' messages from client after ~200 messages
   - Check server logs for "Paused consumer" and "Resumed consumer" messages

## 4. Test Evidence

- Binary frames confirmed in DevTools
- ACK messages sent from client at regular intervals 
- Server log shows pause/resume cycles based on queue depth
- CI test for ACK mechanism passes

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Validator Stream Safety**
   - Switch to streaming parser for large arrays
   - Add size limit for input data

2. **Production Configuration**
   - Complete `values-prod.yaml` for Helm
   - Pin all image tags and set resource limits

3. **CI Pipeline Integration**
   - Add test coverage for pause/resume
   - Implement integration tests with Kafka

4. **Monitoring Dashboards**
   - Export Grafana dashboards for operational metrics
   - Add alerting for consumer lag

These changes ensure the QStrike gateway can handle high-throughput binary Avro messages with proper backpressure, while ensuring tenant isolation through JWT validation.
