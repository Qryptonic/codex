# Dashboard UI Fixes

This document outlines the fixes made to restore the Dashboard UI in the QStrike monorepo.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Fixed Path Alias Issue in App.tsx**
   - Modified import path in `packages/dashboard-ui/src/App.tsx` from `@/hooks/useEvents` to `./hooks/useEvents`
   - This resolves the module resolution error that was preventing the UI from loading

2. **Updated App Title**
   - Changed the title in `packages/dashboard-ui/index.html` from "QStrike 5.1 | Test Version" to "QStrike 5.1 | Quantum Dashboard"
   - Provides a more accurate title for the application

3. **Made Run Script Executable**
   - Ensured that `run-dashboard.sh` is executable with `chmod +x`
   - This script simplifies launching the dashboard UI for development purposes

## Verification

1. **Build Verification**
   - Successfully built the dashboard UI with `npm run build`
   - All files are being correctly bundled by Vite

2. **Import Path Resolution**
   - Fixed the path alias issue that was causing import failures with the `@` alias
   - Verified that relative imports work correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Testing in Browser**
   - Test the UI in a browser to confirm all components render correctly
   - Verify WebSocket connections work as expected

2. **Addressing Test Failures**
   - Some tests are failing due to missing dependencies (`react-test-renderer`) and mocking issues
   - These should be addressed in a follow-up task if needed

3. **Documentation**
   - Update relevant documentation to explain how to run and develop the dashboard UI

## Running the Dashboard

To run the dashboard UI:

```bash
./run-dashboard.sh
```

This will start the development server on port 3000, making the UI accessible at http://localhost:3000.
