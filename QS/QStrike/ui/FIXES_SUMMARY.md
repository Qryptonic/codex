# QStrike UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing tsconfig.node.json File**
   - Created the required `tsconfig.node.json` file with appropriate compiler options
   - This file is referenced in the main `tsconfig.json` and is needed for Vite's TypeScript integration

2. **Path Aliases Configuration**
   - Added `@` path alias in `tsconfig.json` to point to the `src` directory
   - Configured the same alias in `vite.config.ts` to ensure consistent import paths
   - Fixed duplicate `resolve` key in `vite.config.ts` by merging the aliases

3. **Environment Variables Setup**
   - Created `.env.development` file with required environment variables:
     - `VITE_QWS_URL`
     - `VITE_API_URL`
     - `VITE_DEBUG`
     - `VITE_DEMO_FALLBACK_MS`
   - These variables are used in the `env.ts` utility

4. **Buffer Import Fix**
   - Fixed buffer import in `decoder.worker.ts` from `buffer/` to `buffer`

5. **Minimal Test App**
   - Created a minimal test application (`minimal.js`) to verify Vite is working
   - Modified `index.html` to use this simplified entry point for testing

6. **CSS Variable System Implementation**
   - Created a centralized `theme-variables.css` file with all CSS variable definitions
   - Added fallback values to all CSS variable usages for browser compatibility
   - Developed a validation script to ensure all CSS variables are properly defined
   - Added npm script `validate:css` to package.json
   - Updated documentation with comprehensive theming information

## Future Steps

1. **Dependency Conflicts**
   - Fix the peer dependency conflict with `react-hooks-testing-library` (requires React 16.8, but project uses React 18.3)
   - Consider updating to newer testing libraries or using `--legacy-peer-deps` flag during installation

2. **Husky Git Hooks**
   - Fix or configure Husky git hooks which are causing installation failures

3. **Complete UI Testing**
   - Once the basic app is running, gradually re-enable the full React components
   - Test WebSocket functionality with the backend services
