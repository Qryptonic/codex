# CSS Variable System Implementation

## Summary of Changes

Implemented a centralized CSS variable system for the UI to improve maintainability, consistency, and browser compatibility:

1. Created a dedicated `theme-variables.css` file with all CSS variable definitions
2. Added fallback values to all CSS variable usages for browser compatibility
3. Developed a validation script to ensure all CSS variables are properly defined
4. Added npm script `validate:css` to package.json to easily run the validation
5. Updated documentation with comprehensive theming information

## Technical Details

### 1. Centralized CSS Variables

Moved all CSS variables from `cyber-theme.css` to a dedicated `theme-variables.css` file with the following sections:

- Core color palette
- Background colors
- Accent/theme colors
- Provider-specific colors
- Component-specific variables
- Animation durations
- Effect settings (glow, shadows)
- Accessibility overrides

### 2. Fallback Values

Added fallback values to all CSS variable references following this pattern:
```css
var(--variable-name, #fallback-value)
```

This ensures that if a CSS variable isn't loaded or supported, the component will still display correctly.

### 3. Validation Script

Created a `validate-css-vars.cjs` script that:
- Scans all source files for CSS variable usage
- Extracts variable definitions from theme-variables.css
- Reports any variables used but not defined
- Identifies unused variables
- Provides detailed validation output

### 4. Integration with Build Process

Added a new npm script to package.json:
```json
"validate:css": "node validate-css-vars.cjs"
```

This allows developers to easily validate CSS variables during development.

### 5. Documentation

Updated the README.md with detailed information about:
- The CSS variable structure
- How to use the validation script
- Best practices for adding new variables
- Tailwind CSS integration details

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All UI components now use the same set of variables
2. **Maintainability**: Color and style changes can be made in one place
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Fallback values ensure consistent rendering
4. **Validation**: Automated checking prevents undefined variable issues
5. **Documentation**: Clear guidelines for future development

## Next Steps

1. Consider integrating CSS validation into the CI/CD pipeline
2. Implement theme switching functionality using CSS variables
3. Expand Tailwind CSS integration for more variables
