# ðŸ”§ UI Quick Wins Implementation

This PR implements the next-layer "quick wins" after the config/alias cleanup, addressing several improvements to enhance developer experience and code quality.

## âœ… Implemented Improvements

### 1. Lint + Format Gate
- âœ… Updated eslint configuration to extend recommended configs
- âœ… Added prettier integration with eslint-config-prettier
- âœ… Added format script to package.json
- âœ… Improved lint scripts to target src directory
- âœ… Added lint step to CI workflow with --max-warnings 0

### 2. Dependency Sanity
- âœ… Updated vite-plugin-node-polyfills to maintained fork (^0.13.0)
- âœ… Fixed dependency conflicts with clear peer dependencies

### 3. Polyfill Plugin
- âœ… Switched to maintained fork of vite-plugin-node-polyfills
- âœ… Updated vite.config.ts to use NodeGlobalsPolyfillPlugin and NodeModulesPolyfillPlugin
- âœ… Ensured Buffer/process are properly shimmed everywhere

### 4. Worker Build Hint
- âœ… Added Vite worker pragma to decoder.worker.ts
- âœ… Updated worker imports with explicit type: 'module'
- âœ… Ensured worker is properly bundled for production

### 5. Single Source of Environment
- âœ… Created .env.development.example with browser-only variables
- âœ… Ensured all env variables have VITE_ prefix
- âœ… Removed backend secrets from client-side env config

### 6. Minimal README for Newcomers
- âœ… Added concise "Quick Start" guide
- âœ… Documented development commands and project structure
- âœ… Provided clear instructions for both local and Docker setups
- âœ… Linked to detailed documentation for advanced users

### 7. Smoke Test Expansion
- âœ… Enhanced App smoke test with proper mocks
- âœ… Added framer-motion mocks to avoid happy-dom issues
- âœ… Added Three.js mocks for WebGL components
- âœ… Structured tests with describe/it blocks

### 8. Git Hygiene
- âœ… Updated .gitignore with better patterns
- âœ… Added exception for .env*.example files
- âœ… Ignored *.local.*, logs, and test results
- âœ… Improved organization of ignore patterns

### 9. Docker Refresh
- âœ… Created docker-compose.dev.yml with improved configuration
- âœ… Mounted node_modules as cached volume for better performance
- âœ… Added CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=1 for reliable HMR on macOS
- âœ… Updated to use port 5173 for consistency

### 10. Visual Win (Existing)
- âœ… Leveraged existing favicon.svg with quantum circuit design

## ðŸ§ª Testing and Verification

All changes have been tested and verified to work properly:

- Lint and format commands working correctly
- Smoke tests pass successfully
- Docker development environment boots properly
- Environment variables load correctly
- Worker polyfills function in both development and production

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Continue with the backend README update to use UI on port 5173
2. Consider adding type checking to the CI workflow
3. Explore bundle size optimization
4. Enhance test coverage with component-specific tests
